\begin{defn}
	Let $D \subset \mathbb{R},$ $f:D\to\mathbb{R}$ and $c \in D.$ We say that $f$ is continuous at $c$ if
	\[(x_n) \text{ is a sequence in } D,\;x_n \to c \implies f(x_n) \to f(c).\]
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	Let $D \subset \mathbb{R},$ $f:D\to\mathbb{R}$ and $c \in D.$ We say that $f$ is continuous at $c$ if:\\
	For every $\epsilon > 0,$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
	\[x \in D \text{ and } |x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon.\]
\end{defn}
We shall now prove the equivalence of the two definitions.\\
\begin{proof}
	Definition 2 $\implies$ Definition 1:\\
	Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let $(x_n)$ be any sequence in $D$ such that $x_n \to c.$ We must show that $f(x_n) \to f(c).$\\
	By hypothesis, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $x \in D$ and $|x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon.$ \hfill (1)\\
	As $x_n \to c,$ there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|x_n - c| < \delta$ for all $n \ge n_0.$\\
	Therefore, by (1), we have it that $|f(x_n) - f(c)| < \epsilon$ for all $n \ge n_0.$ This is precisely what it means for $f(x_n) \to f(c).$\\~\\
	%
	Definition 1 $\implies$ Definition 2:\\
	We shall prove this by proving its contrapositive. That is, we assume that the $\epsilon-\delta$ condition does not hold and show that the sequential criterion does not hold either.\\
	By assumption, there exists $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that for all $\delta > 0,$ we have it that there exists $x \in D$ such that $|x - c| < \delta$ but $|f(x) - f(c)| \ge \epsilon_0.$ \hfill (2)\\
	Using this, we shall now construct a sequence $(x_n)$ in $D$ such that $x_n \to c$ but $f(x_n) \not\to f(c).$\\
	Let $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ As (2) is true for all $\delta > 0,$ we can choose $\delta = 1/n.$ Thus, there exists $x_n \in D$ such that $|x_n - c| < 1/n$ and $|f(x_n) - f(c)| \ge \epsilon_0.$\\
	Thus, we now have a sequence $(x_n)$ in $D$ such that $x_n \to c.$ However, if choose $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 > 0,$ we have it that $|f(x_n) - f(c)| \ge \epsilon$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ Thus, $f(x_n)$ can not converge to $f(c).$
\end{proof}

	\emph{Remark.} We require Axiom of Choice (or one of its weaker version) for this argument.
